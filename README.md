# Keyframed-Audioplayer

This was made as an entry to the [2019 r/programmerhumor hackathon](https://www.programmerhumor.org/Hackathon).

It is a fully functional web component audio player with the added feature of keyframable audio.

Audio is able to be changed over time using keyframes created with a click of a mouse. Yes, this is utterly useless in 99& of situations. No one asked for this. That's why I submitted it for the category of "over-engineering".

Made with Stencil JS and vanilla canvas.
